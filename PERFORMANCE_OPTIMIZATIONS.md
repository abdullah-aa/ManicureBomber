# Performance Optimizations for Manicure Bomber

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented to address jittery gameplay after the Tomahawk missile was added.

## Major Performance Issues Identified

### 1. TomahawkMissile.ts - Particle System Overhead
**Issues:**
- 5 separate particle systems with high particle counts (3000+ particles total)
- Expensive curved path calculations every frame
- No update frequency limiting

**Optimizations:**
- Reduced particle counts by 50-60%:
  - Exhaust particles: 150 → 80
  - Trail particles: 300 → 150
  - Smoke particles: 100 → 50
  - Fire explosion: 3000 → 1500
  - Explosion smoke: 1500 → 800
- Added frame rate limiting (60 FPS max updates)
- Implemented curve position caching to avoid redundant calculations
- Reduced cleanup times (1500ms → 1000ms, 8000ms → 6000ms)

### 2. RadarManager.ts - DOM Manipulation Overhead
**Issues:**
- Clearing and recreating all DOM markers every frame
- No object pooling
- Expensive building queries every frame

**Optimizations:**
- Implemented object pooling for radar markers (50 max markers)
- Reduced update frequency to 100ms intervals
- Added position and rotation caching with thresholds
- Limited marker count to prevent DOM overflow
- Cached building queries to avoid repeated expensive operations

### 3. Game.ts - Main Loop Inefficiencies
**Issues:**
- All systems updating every frame regardless of importance
- No frame rate limiting
- Expensive operations in critical path

**Optimizations:**
- Implemented frame rate limiting (60 FPS target)
- Separated critical vs non-critical updates:
  - Critical: Input, bomber movement, camera, bombs (every frame)
  - Non-critical: Terrain (100ms), Defense (50ms), UI (50ms), Radar (100ms)
- Added position caching for building height calculations
- Reduced expensive terrain and defense updates

### 4. TerrainManager.ts - Building Query Overhead
**Issues:**
- Expensive distance calculations for all buildings
- No spatial partitioning
- Repeated queries for same positions

**Optimizations:**
- Implemented building query caching (1 second timeout)
- Added spatial partitioning with grid-based filtering
- Pre-filtered chunks by distance before building checks
- Cached results based on position and radius

### 5. UIManager.ts - DOM Update Overhead
**Issues:**
- DOM updates every frame regardless of changes
- No change detection
- Synchronous updates blocking render loop

**Optimizations:**
- Implemented change detection for all UI elements
- Added batched updates using requestAnimationFrame timing
- Separated update logic into specific methods
- Only update DOM when values actually change

### 6. B2Bomber.ts - Target Finding Overhead
**Issues:**
- Expensive target finding every frame
- No caching of results

**Optimizations:**
- Already had good caching implemented (0.5s intervals)
- Position-based cache invalidation (50 unit threshold)
- Target validity verification

## Additional Optimizations

### Performance Monitoring
- Added real-time FPS display
- Frame time warnings for performance debugging
- Console logging for performance issues

### Memory Management
- Reduced particle system cleanup times
- Implemented object pooling for DOM elements
- Added chunk cleanup limits to prevent memory leaks

### Rendering Optimizations
- Reduced terrain subdivisions where appropriate
- Optimized sky dome rendering
- Limited maximum chunks to prevent memory issues

## Performance Results

### Before Optimizations:
- Frame drops during missile launches
- Jittery camera movement
- High CPU usage from particle systems
- DOM thrashing from radar updates

### After Optimizations:
- Stable 60 FPS target
- Smooth camera movement
- Reduced particle system overhead
- Efficient DOM updates with object pooling
- Cached calculations reducing CPU load

## Configuration Options

The optimizations include configurable parameters that can be adjusted based on target hardware:

- `targetFrameRate`: 60 FPS (adjustable)
- `updateIntervals`: Various update frequencies for different systems
- `particleCounts`: Reduced but still visually appealing
- `cacheTimeouts`: Balance between performance and accuracy
- `maxMarkers`: Limit DOM elements for radar

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Level of Detail (LOD)**: Implement distance-based detail reduction
2. **Frustum Culling**: Only render visible objects
3. **Instanced Rendering**: For repeated geometry like buildings
4. **WebGL Optimizations**: Shader optimizations and draw call batching
5. **Asset Streaming**: Load/unload assets based on proximity

## Testing Recommendations

1. Monitor FPS during missile launches
2. Test with multiple missiles active simultaneously
3. Verify smooth camera movement during high-action sequences
4. Check memory usage over extended gameplay sessions
5. Test on lower-end devices to ensure performance targets are met
