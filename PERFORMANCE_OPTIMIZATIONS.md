// Iskander missile physics with advanced guidance
if (data.missileType === 'iskander') {
    // Check for flare targets (optimized)
    const flareResult = checkForFlareTargets(
        position, flareTargets, flareDetectionRange, originalTargetPosition
    );
    
    // Lock-on system
    const lockResult = updateIskanderLockOnSystem(
        position, targetPosition, lockOnRange, isLockedOn, 
        lockOnTime, lockOnDuration, deltaTime
    );
    
    // Advanced guidance based on lock status
    if (isLockedOn) {
        const guidanceResult = updateIskanderLockedOnGuidance(
            position, velocity, targetPosition, speed,
            guidanceStrength, maxTurnRate, deltaTime
        );
    } else {
        const guidanceResult = updateIskanderInitialGuidance(
            position, velocity, targetPosition, speed,
            maxTurnRate, deltaTime
        );
    }
}
```

#### Optimized Flare Targeting

```typescript
function checkForFlareTargets(
    position: Vector3, 
    flareTargets: Vector3[], 
    flareDetectionRange: number,
    originalTargetPosition: Vector3
): { targetPosition: Vector3; isTargetingFlare: boolean; flareTargets: Vector3[] } {
    // Clear old flare targets that are too far away (optimization)
    const filteredFlareTargets = flareTargets.filter(flarePos => {
        const distanceToFlare = vector3Distance(position, flarePos);
        return distanceToFlare <= flareDetectionRange * 2;
    });

    // Find closest flare within detection range
    let closestFlare: Vector3 | null = null;
    let closestDistance = Infinity;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < filteredFlareTargets.length; i++) {
        const flarePos = filteredFlareTargets[i];
        const distanceToFlare = vector3Distance(position, flarePos);
        
        if (distanceToFlare <= flareDetectionRange && distanceToFlare < closestDistance) {
            closestFlare = flarePos;
            closestDistance = distanceToFlare;
        }
    }
    
    return {
        targetPosition: closestFlare || originalTargetPosition,
        isTargetingFlare: !!closestFlare,
        flareTargets: filteredFlareTargets
    };
}
```

#### Advanced Lock-on System

```typescript
function updateIskanderLockOnSystem(
    position: Vector3,
    targetPosition: Vector3,
    lockOnRange: number,
    isLockedOn: boolean,
    lockOnTime: number,
    lockOnDuration: number,
    deltaTime: number
): { isLockedOn: boolean; lockOnTime: number; lockEstablished: boolean } {
    const distanceToTarget = vector3Distance(position, targetPosition);
    let newLockOnTime = lockOnTime;
    let newIsLockedOn = isLockedOn;
    let lockEstablished = false;
    
    if (distanceToTarget <= lockOnRange) {
        if (!isLockedOn) {
            newLockOnTime += deltaTime;
            if (newLockOnTime >= lockOnDuration) {
                newIsLockedOn = true;
                lockEstablished = true;
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Reset lock if target is out of range
        newIsLockedOn = false;
        newLockOnTime = 0;
    }
    
    return { isLockedOn: newIsLockedOn, lockOnTime: newLockOnTime, lockEstablished };

## Implementation Details

### Worker Manager Integration

The `WorkerManager` class provides centralized worker communication:

```typescript
// Example usage for Iskander missiles
const result = await this.workerManager.updateMissilePhysics({
    position: { x: this.position.x, y: this.position.y, z: this.position.z },
    velocity: { x: this.velocity.x, y: this.velocity.y, z: this.velocity.z },
    missileType: 'iskander',
    // ... Iskander-specific properties
    flareTargets: this.flareTargets.map(flare => ({ x: flare.x, y: flare.y, z: flare.z })),
    lockOnRange: this.lockOnRange,
    isLockedOn: this.isLockedOn,
    // ... additional properties
});
```

### Fallback Mechanisms

The system includes robust fallback mechanisms:

```typescript
private async updatePhysicsWithWorker(deltaTime: number, currentTime: number): Promise<void> {
    try {
        const result = await this.workerManager.updateMissilePhysics(physicsData);
        this.applyPhysicsResult(result);
    } catch (error) {
        console.warn('Worker physics update failed, falling back to main thread:', error);
        this.updatePhysicsMainThread(deltaTime, currentTime);
    }
}
```
